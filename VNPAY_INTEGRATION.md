# VNPay Payment Integration Guide

## Overview
The project has been integrated with VNPay payment gateway to handle movie ticket payments after users confirm their bookings.

## Configuration

### 1. VNPay Configuration in appsettings.json
```json
{
  "VNPay": {
    "TmnCode": "VVHLKKC6",
    "HashSecret": "E3N6K0GJZEDZKTV7LHZ0DUMZRSGV3XZS",
    "BaseUrl": "https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/paymentv2/vpcpay.html",
    "Command": "pay",
    "CurrCode": "VND",
    "Version": "2.1.0",
    "Locale": "vn",
    "ReturnUrl": "https://localhost:7001/api/Payment/vnpay-return",
    "IpnUrl": "https://localhost:7001/api/Payment/vnpay-ipn",
    "ExpiredTime": 15
  }
}
```

### 2. Configuration Parameters
- **TmnCode**: Website code at VNPAY
- **HashSecret**: Secret string to create signature
- **BaseUrl**: VNPay payment gateway URL (sandbox for testing)
- **ReturnUrl**: Callback URL when payment is completed
- **IpnUrl**: URL to receive notifications from VNPay (server-to-server)
- **ExpiredTime**: Payment expiration time (minutes)

## Workflow

### 1. Booking
1. User selects movie, date, time and seats
2. Confirms booking information
3. System creates invoice with "Payment Pending" status (Status = 1)
4. Redirects to Payment page

### 2. Payment
1. Payment page displays booking information and "Pay Now" button
2. Click payment button â†’ redirects to VNPay
3. User makes payment on VNPay
4. VNPay calls back to ReturnUrl or IpnUrl

### 3. Callback Processing
1. **ReturnUrl** (client-side): Displays result to user
2. **IpnUrl** (server-side): Updates invoice status
3. If payment is successful:
   - Updates invoice status to "Payment Successful" (Status = 2)
   - Adds points for customer
   - Redirects to Success page

## Files Created/Updated

### Controllers
- `BookingController.cs`: Added VNPayService, modified Confirm action, added Payment action
- `PaymentController.cs`: Handles VNPay callbacks

### Models
- `VNPayConfig.cs`: VNPay configuration model
- `PaymentViewModel.cs`: ViewModel for Payment page

### Services
- `VNPayService.cs`: Creates payment URL and validates signature
- `InvoiceService.cs`: Added status update methods
- `AccountService.cs`: Added point addition methods

### Repository
- `InvoiceRepository.cs`: Added status update methods
- `AccountRepository.cs`: Added point addition methods

### Views
- `Payment.cshtml`: Page to display payment information

## Invoice Status
- **Status = 1**: Payment Pending
- **Status = 2**: Payment Successful
- **Status = 3**: Payment Failed

## Important Notes

### 1. Test Environment
- Use VNPay sandbox for testing
- Callback URLs must be HTTPS or localhost
- Can test with VNPay test cards

### 2. Security
- HashSecret must be kept secure
- Validate signature from VNPay
- Check ResponseCode = "00" to confirm success

### 3. Error Handling
- Display clear error messages to users
- Log errors for debugging
- Have retry mechanism when needed

### 4. Production
- Change BaseUrl to production
- Update ReturnUrl and IpnUrl
- Use real TmnCode and HashSecret
- Configure SSL certificate

## Testing
1. Run the application
2. Login with Member account
3. Book a movie ticket
4. Confirm booking
5. Go to Payment page
6. Click "Pay Now"
7. Make payment on VNPay (can use test cards)
8. Check callback and status update

## Troubleshooting
- Check logs for debugging
- Verify VNPay signature
- Check callback URL configuration
- Ensure database connection
- Check file permissions
